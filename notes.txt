Todo:
  - Connect the CE pin to a digital output on the microcontroller
  - The LIN BUS stuff is confusing.  One the schematic the TX/RX on the
    motor driver is connected to the TX/RX on the MCU.  Reading the docs
    though (3.8/3.9) it seems though that this is correct.
  - The FAULTn/TXE pin needs to be driven be a microcontroller digital
    input/output pin.
  - Break out the lin bus stuff
  - Find a TX/RX pins on the MCU and hook them to DE2.

What do we need on the MCU?
  - Digital output for the CE pin
  - Digital input/output for the FAULTn/TXE pin
  - Sender/receiver for the LIN bus
  - CAN bus

Thoughts:
  - Need to look more into LIN bus.  Not sure if I need it.
